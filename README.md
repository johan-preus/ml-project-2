## Summary

We studied a case of excessive enrollment in nursery schools in Ljubljana, Slovenia.  A ML algorithm was used to address the **excessive enrollment** issue providing a framework for evaluating and ranking applications​. *Various machine learning methodologies offer distinct advantages and trade-offs in predicting nursery school admissions* based on factors such as parents' occupation and family structure. The implications of each are significant.​

## Results

Each methodology offers unique advantages and challenges in analyzing the nursery dataset.  By understanding the strengths and limitations of each methodology, we can choose the most appropriate approach to analyze the nursery dataset and gain valuable insights into factors influencing nursery school admissions or any other subject.

**An important conclusion, especially for us as students, is realizing how choosing the right methodology can have an impact on real-life scenarios and affect people in the offline life.**
